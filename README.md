⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch (if used)

Tools: Jupyter, Git, Streamlit/Flask (if deployed)



🚀 Project Workflow

Data Collection → Load dataset from [source / Kaggle / API].

Data Preprocessing → Cleaning, handling missing values, encoding, scaling.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) → Visualizations, feature correlations, distributions.

Model Training → Train/test split, baseline model, hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation → Metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC.

Deployment (Optional) → Model served via Flask/Streamlit API.
